# Week 5

## Feedback

### Sessions

**Damir, 24 years, alumni**

Recent graduate seeking project collaborators

> "When browsing projects, I can't see who's already on the team. This is crucial - I don't want to apply if there's already 5 developers. Also, I need to bookmark interesting projects to revisit later."
> 

**Pain points:**

- Zero visibility into existing team composition
- No way to save/track preferred projects

**Aliya, 20 years, 2nd year bachelor student**

Frontend developer seeking team roles

> "How exactly does my profile appear to project owners? Can I update my skills after creating my profile? Having multiple resumes for different goals would be perfect."
> 

**Pain points:**

- Uncertainty about profile presentation
- Profile fields locked after initial setup
- Need for specialized profiles

**Alyona, 20 years, 2nd year bachelor student**

Student exploring projects where she can be DevOps

> "Is there any search function? Usually my friends make project and then we all in it. I dont want to waste a lot of time to search project, so search system would be perfect"
> 

**Pain points:**

- No search system
- Manual discovery is time-consuming

### Analyze

**Fundamental feature gaps**

- Missing project search blocks core discovery
- Locked profiles prevent skill updates
- Hidden team members cause misaligned applications

**High-impact workflow issues:**

- No project bookmarking reduces re-engagement
- Single-profile limitation hinders role flexibility
- Unclear profile visibility creates anxiety

| **Issue** | **Priority** | **User impact** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlock profile editing | P0 (Critical) | Allows skill/role updates |
| Show team members | P0 (Critical) | Prevents wasted applications |
| Favorite projects | P2 (Medium) | Improves re-engagement |
| Profile visibility docs | P2 (Medium) | Clarifies privacy concerns |
| Multi-resume system | P3 (Low) | Supports different goals |
| Add project search | P3 (Low) | Enables efficient discovery |

## Iteration & Refinement

### Implemented features based on feedback

*…*

### Performance & Stability

*How would you measure the performance of your application? Calculate the metrics that are suitable for your project and find out if they can be improved in any way, if necessary.*

### Documentation

To keep our project organized and accessible, we maintain a structured Notion workspace. It includes dedicated sections for product planning, development, documentation, and communication. Here’s a breakdown of the key categories:

**Concept & Planning**

- Idea – problem statement and target audience
- User Stories – all current user stories and acceptance criteria

**Rules & Guidelines**

- Правила ведения репозитория – Team agreement on how to manage branches, commits, and pull requests
- Работа с SSO – Instructions for integrating Microsoft Entra (SSO)
- Submissions – Capstone report submission links

**Developer Sections**

- ML notes
- Frontend notes
- Backend notes

**Management & Coordination**

- Future Improvements – brainstorming and feature backlog beyond MVP
- Requirements – system and functional requirements documentation (will be soon)
- Meeting with Stakeholders – interview notes and next steps from meetings with Potyomkin, Marko, Mansur, and others.

For the ML part we use Swagger (via FastAPI) because it’s auto-generated and helpful for quick testing and integration. It documents input/output formats, lets us test endpoints right in the browser, and keeps backend/ML/frontend aligned without writing extra docs

### ML Model Refinement

*If applicable: Describe the process of improving the quality of your ML model, how you managed to achieve this and how you plan to improve it further.*
